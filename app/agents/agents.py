"""
AutoGen Agent System with Performance Optimizations.

This module implements an autonomous agent system using Microsoft's AutoGen framework.
The agents work together to provide enhanced document processing and question answering.

Key Optimizations:
1. Timeout configurations to prevent hanging
2. Limited auto-replies to prevent infinite loops
3. Simplified agent interactions to reduce processing time
4. Deferred initialization to improve startup performance

Agent Architecture:
- User_Proxy: Handles user interactions and coordinates other agents
- Document_Processor: Specializes in document analysis and processing
- QA_Specialist: Focuses on question understanding and answer generation
- RAG_Coordinator: Manages RAG system operations and coordination

Performance Notes:
- Agent initialization: ~5-10 seconds (includes LLM connection setup)
- Agent conversations: ~2-5 seconds per interaction
- Timeout protection: 30 seconds per agent call

    Autonomous Agent System with Performance Optimizations.

    This class orchestrates multiple AutoGen agents to provide enhanced document processing
    and question answering capabilities. Each agent has specialized roles and they coordinate
    to deliver comprehensive responses.

    Optimization Features:
    - Timeout Protection: 30-second timeouts prevent infinite hanging
    - Loop Prevention: Max 1 auto-reply prevents endless agent conversations
    - Simplified Workflows: Reduced agent interactions for faster processing
    - Model Flexibility: Supports both local (Ollama) and cloud (OpenAI) LLMs

    Agent Roles:
    - User_Proxy: Interface between user and agent system
    - Document_Processor: Document analysis and text extraction expert
    - QA_Specialist: Question understanding and answer formulation
    - RAG_Coordinator: RAG system management and coordination

    Performance Impact:
    - Initialization: ~5-10 seconds (LLM connections + agent setup)
    - Document Processing: ~3-7 seconds (agent coordination)
