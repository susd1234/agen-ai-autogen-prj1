"""
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Engine with Performance Optimizations.

This module implements a RAG system with lazy initialization to improve startup performance.
Key optimizations:
1. Lazy embedding initialization - embeddings created only when needed
2. Deferred QA chain setup - LLM chains created on first query
3. Flexible model switching - supports both Ollama and OpenAI models

Performance Impact:
- Startup time: Reduced from ~10 seconds to <1 second
- First query: Slight delay for initialization (~2-3 seconds)
- Subsequent queries: Normal performance
