"""
FastAPI Application for Agentic RAG System with Performance Optimizations.

This module provides REST API endpoints for document upload and question answering.
Key optimization: Deferred processing strategy for improved user experience.

Performance Strategy:
- Upload Endpoint: Fast response (~2 seconds) with deferred heavy processing
- Question Endpoint: Handles deferred processing on first question (~10-15 seconds)
- Health Endpoints: Quick system status checks

API Design:
- RESTful endpoints following OpenAPI standards
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Prometheus metrics integration for monitoring
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

Optimization Benefits:
- Upload response time: 30+ seconds â†’ 2 seconds
- Better user experience with immediate feedback
- System resources used only when needed
- Graceful degradation on component failures

    Upload and process a document with optimized performance strategy.

    This endpoint implements a deferred processing approach for maximum responsiveness:
    1. Save uploaded file to storage (fast)
    2. Extract text content (fast)
    3. Defer heavy processing (RAG + agents) until first question

    Performance Optimization:
    - Before: 30+ seconds (full RAG + agent processing)
    - After: ~2 seconds (file operations + text extraction only)
    - Heavy processing moved to first question for better UX

    Args:
        file (UploadFile): The document file to upload (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

    Returns:
        Dict containing:
            - message: Success status with processing info
            - filename: Name of the uploaded file

    Raises:
        HTTPException:
            - 400: If no filename provided
            - 500: If document processing fails

    API Usage Example:
        ```python
        files = {"file": ("document.pdf", open("document.pdf", "rb"), "application/pdf")}
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/upload", files=files)
        ```

    Design Rationale:
        This deferred approach provides immediate user feedback while ensuring
        system resources are used efficiently. Heavy processing occurs only
        when users actually ask questions about the documents.
